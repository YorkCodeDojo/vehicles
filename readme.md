# 1-trillion line problem


## Setup

The generated files contains a number of measures for your fleet of vehicles.
Each measurement shows how far a vehicle travelled in one minute.

The solutions should be O(n) in time complexity.  (ie sorting isn't allowed)

## Exercises

1. Download left.csv

2. What is the total distance travelled by all vehicles?

3. Which vehicle travelled the most distance?

4. Which vehicle travelled the furthest in 5 minutes,  and how far did they travel?

5. How many times did vehicle 1 overtake vehicle 2?

6. It turns out that the data is often wrong,  but that's ok as this file is only the measurement from the front left-hand wheel.  
   Using a second file using right.csv.   This gives the data for the front-right wheel.  Repeat the exercises using the average of the 
   of the two measurements.



## Files can be generated by:

generate_data left.csv --seed 1234 --cars 10 --hours 24 

generate_data right.csv --seed 9999 --cars 10 --hours 24
