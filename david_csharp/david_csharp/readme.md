# 1-trillion line problem


## Setup

Run the supplied application in order to create your test data.  The 
generated files contains a number of measures for your fleet of vehicles.
Each measurement shows how far a vehicle travelled in one minute.

The solutions should be O(n) in time complexity.  (ie sorting isn't allowed)

## Exercises

1. Create your test data by ....

2. What is the total distance travelled by all vehicles?

3. Which vehicle travelled the most distance?

4. Which vehicle travelled the furthest in 5 minutes,  and how far did they travel?

5. How many times did vehicle 1 overtake vehicle 2?

6. It turns out that the data is often wrong,  but that's ok as this file is only the measurement from the front left-hand wheel.  
   Create a second file using xxxxx.   This gives the data for the front-right wheel.  Repeat the exercises using the average of the 
   of the two measurements.
